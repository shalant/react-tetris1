# I built Tetris using React, following Weibenfalk's Youtube tutorial

I decided to do this project because it would be interesting to see the moderate Javascript involved in game logic. This React tutorial also used custom hooks, useRef, useState, useEffect, useCallback, and Styled Components for custom css. 

## Next steps

For now, my portfolio page has a link to this fully operational game, but I aspire to embed it into my future site.
